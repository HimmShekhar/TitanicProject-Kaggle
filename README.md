# TitanicProject-Kaggle

This Project is a Kaggle Challenge on Titanic Dataset.

Here's a list of questions we'll try to answer using data analysis skills with Python!


1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3.) Where did the passengers come from?
4.) Who was alone and who was with family?
5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
6.) Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate? Did this answer match up with your intuition?
7.) Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?
